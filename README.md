ScreenHax
=========

## How to use

Build the app and sideload onto your phone using ADB or Android Studio.

Once it's installed, go to your phone's Accessibility settings, select Installed Apps, and look for
ScreenHax. Once turned on, it will inject a touch event to your screen (at coordinates 0,0) every 30
seconds, which should prevent your display from auto-locking.

I recommend enabling the accessibility button shortcut option, which will allow you to turn it on or
off very easily by tapping the little person icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
